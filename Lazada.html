			<p align = "justify">Lazada Group was founded in 2012 by Maximilian Bittner with the backing of Rocket Internet with the intention
			of establishing the Amazon.com business model in Southeast Asia to take advantage of the nascent online consumer market 
			and Amazon's weak presence there; Rocket is a German incubator that builds companies that copy the business models 
			of successful US tech companies in emerging markets.Lazada's e-commerce websites soft launched in 2012. 
			It raised four rounds of funding in 2012 and early 2013: JP Morgan invested an undisclosed amount in September, Swedish
			investment firm Kinnevik invested $40 million in November, American private equity firm Summit Partners invested $26 
			million in December, and Tengelmann invested about $20 million in January 2013. It also added a 2-day guaranteed 
			delivery services, addressing one of the most common complaints about Lazada's service, and one of its biggest
			challenges, which it had attempted to address by making a "massive, incalculable investment" in warehouses and delivery 
			services.</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">In June 2013, Lazada announced it had raised an additional $100 million, and it launched mobile applications for 
				Android and iOS devices. In December 2013, it raised an additional $250 million from Tesco PLC, Access Industries,
				and other existing investors. In May 2014, Lazada launched in Singapore.</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">In November 2014, Temasek Holdings in Singapore led a funding round of $250 million, bringing the 
			total Lazada had raised to approximately $647 million. Also that month, Lazada announced that its marketplace platform 
			accounted for more than 65% of its overall sales, and that the number of third-party sellers on the platform had increased 
			from ~500 in November 2013, to close to 10,000 in December 2014. The number of employees across the region reached 
			approximately 4,000.</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify"> For 2014, Lazada's net operating losses were $152.5 million on net revenues of $154.3 million.
			[However, its percentage of losses relative to its Gross Merchandise Volume - the value of all the products sold 
			through the site - was smaller in 2014 than in 2013 due to growth in its GMV from $95 million in 2013 to $384 million in 
			2014, driven by marketplace sales.</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify"> In 2015, Lazada's challenges for growth were the preference for brick and mortar shopping among customers,
			with just about 1% of people buying online compared to 10% of International shoppers; the lack of credit cards and concomitant
			requirement to arrange cash on delivery systems, reliable delivery especially in rural regions, and the threat of competition 
			from Amazon and Alibaba.</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">In March 2016, Lazada claimed it recorded a total of $1.36 billion in annual GMV across its six markets 
			in Southeast Asia, making it the largest e-commerce player.</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">In April 2016, Alibaba Group announced that it intended to acquire a controlling interest in Lazada by
			paying $500 million for new shares and buying $500M worth of shares from existing investors. The British supermarket company
			Tesco confirmed the sale of 8.6% of its holding in Lazada to Alibaba for $129 million. Alibaba gave the following reasons
			for its investment: the market in South-East Asia has growing middle class income populations, estimated at that time to be 
			around 190 million people in the region with a disposable income of $16-$100 a day, and this was expected to grow to 400 million
			people in 2020.</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">In June 2017, Alibaba Group increased its investment in Lazada by an additional $1 billion, raising its 
			stake from 51% to 83%. Alibaba invested another $2 billion into Lazada in March 2018, and founder Max Bittner was replaced 
			as CEO by Alibaba executive Lucy Peng. In December 2018, Peng was replaced by Pierre Poignant as CEO of Lazada, with Peng taking the role of 
			executive chairwoman. In June 2020, Pierre Poignant was replaced by Chun Li as CEO of Lazada.</p>
			<br>

			to uplift the end-to-end shopping journey and build a sustainable and healthy business The shopee is popular in today's pandemic
