			<p align = "justify">The foodpanda group is the leading global online food delivery marketplace. Headquartered in Berlin, Germany. 
			It operates in more than 40 countries across 5 continents. foodpanda allows users to conveniently discover food
			around their neighbourhood and directly order their favourite meals online or via mobile.</p>	
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">In 2012, Lukas Nagel and Rico Wyder established Foodpanda in Singapore and later expanded in Malaysia, 
			Indonesia, Thailand. Foodpanda was launched in 2013 in Romania and in 2014 expanded in Hungary and Balkans. In 2014,
			Foodpanda expanded its service into the Philippines. Shortly after, global expansion of the Foodpanda business was 
			led by Ralf Wenzel, Felix Plog and Ben Bauer. From 2019 to 2020, foodpanda expanded in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos.
			Foodpanda was launched in Japan, in September 2020 covering 6 cities including Kobe, Yokohama, Nagoya, Sapporo,
			Fukuoka and Hiroshima and later Osaka and Kyoto.</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">In the Philippines, foodpanda was launched in June 2014 and has since grown to over 1,000 partner restaurants nationwide. 
			We are a small team of problem solvers, designers, thinkers and tinkers, working around the clock to make foodpanda 
			the most powerful online tool for food delivery.</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">As a frequent user of food delivery apps, what makes foodpanda a cut above the rest in terms of 
			convenience is its card payment option. This hasn’t only helped me satisfy my food cravings even if I didn’t have any 
			cash on hand, this has also been proven very useful at times that I needed to order big batches of food for work or 
			family celebrations. The deals aren’t just much cheaper, delivery is also faster than their other delivery apps. 
			You can even get special access to events and other promos all in one app. More than the convenience, foodpanda is 
			also changing the game in terms of environmental impact. They’ve launched a series of green efforts last year in line 
			with their Go Green Campaign including the opt-in/out cutlery initiative (an option to not have single-use plastic 
			utensils to go with your order) and bike delivery service. We might even see walkers as part of their delivery fleet
			in the future. And it’s not only the consumers who are feeling the foodpanda effect but their partner restaurants as well. 
			Though they’ve been successful as they are, restaurants like Frankie’s New York Buffalo Wings, Hummus Elijah, and 101 
			Hawker Food House were able to reach and serve more customers through the food delivery app. This 2020, we can only expect
			more from foodpanda: more cities to paint pink, more partner restaurants, more unbelievable discounts, still the lowest 
			delivery fee, and for them to stay true their promise to deliver while we enjoy.</p> </div>
