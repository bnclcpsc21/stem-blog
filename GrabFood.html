			<p align = "justify">Grab Holdings Inc., commonly known as Grab, is a Singaporean multinational ride-hailing company headquartered 
			in Queenstown, Singapore. In addition to transportation, the company offers food delivery and digital payments 
			services via a mobile app. It now operates in the Southeast Asian countries of Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, 
			Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, and the East Asian country of Japan. It is Southeast Asia's first
			"decacorn" (a startup with a valuation of over US$10 billion) </p> 	 
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Grab’s food business started in 2016, but expanded broadly across Southeast Asia last year after the 
			start-up acquired Uber’s regional operations that included UberEats. The service was available in two Indonesian cities at 
			the start of 2018 but is currently present in more than 200 cities mostly across Indonesia, and also in Thailand, Malaysia,
			Singapore, Philippines, and Vietnam. The company says its gross merchandise volume for the food business grew 900% on-year 
			in June 2019 from a relatively small base. GMV is a commonly tracked metric by e-commerce companies that measures the total
			sales dollar value of goods sold on their platforms. For the same period, delivery volume grew seven times, according to Grab. 
			Overall, GrabFood accounts for around 20% of Grab’s total GMV at the moment, compared to less than 5% in 2018. Lim explained 
			that the “room for growth is still tremendous” in Southeast Asia, where food delivery is still at a nascent stage compared 
			to markets such as China and the United States.</p>
			<br>
			 • GrabFood has been voted by Filipino consumers as their most often used food delivery platform in the Philippines – 
			 a position it has held for 10 consecutive months
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 • GrabFood has been a reliable partner of Filipinos a daily essential for some.</p> </div>
