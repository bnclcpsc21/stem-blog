			<p align = "justify">Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with 
			messages known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read them. 
			Users access Twitter through its website interface or its mobile-device application software ("app"), though the service could 
			also be accessed via SMS before April 2020. Twitter, Inc. is based in San Francisco, California, and has more than 25 
			offices around the world. Tweets were originally restricted to 140 characters, but was doubled to 280 for non-CJK languages 
			in November 2017. Audio and video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds for most accounts. Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, 
			Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and launched in July of that year. By 2012, more than 100 million users 
			posted 340 million tweets a day, and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day. In 
			2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as "the SMS of the Internet". As of Q1 2019, 
			Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users. Twitter is a some-to-many microblogging service, given that the 
			vast majority of tweets are written by a small minority of users.</p> 	 
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Twitter's origins lie in a "daylong brainstorming session" held by board members of the podcasting company 
			Odeo. Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student at New York University, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS 
			service to communicate with a small group.[23][24] The original project code name for the service was twttr, an idea that 
			Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass,[25] inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The 
			decision was also partly due to the fact that the domain twitter.com was already in use, and it was six months after the launch 
			of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter.[26] The developers initially 
			considered "10958" as a short code, but later changed it to "40404" for "ease of use and memorability".[27] Work on the project 
			started on March 21, 2006, when Dorsey published the first Twitter message at 9:50 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST): 
			"just setting up my twttr".[3] Dorsey has explained the origin of the "Twitter" title:</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">...we came across the word 'twitter', and it was just perfect. The definition was 'a short burst of inconsequential</p>
			<p align = "justify">information,' and 'chirps from birds'. And that's exactly what the product was.</p> 
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">In the sea of different social media networking sites, there are winners and there are losers. Among the 
			winners, there is an undisputed top tier. In the great scheme of things, the newest social networking super power is the text-
			driven Twitter. Unlike other popular social media websites, Twitter trims the fat and streamlines the process of sharing to make 
			it the fastest avenue for spreading news and info virally. By sharing links to news articles, videos and websites, information 
			travels as fast as fingers can type and press the “enter” key. While Twitter may not yet be as widely used as its predecessors 
			and remaining rivals, it does offer an innovative approach to social networking. It is no longer just individual users who are 
			attracted to the site: Businesses are waking up to the marketing and advertising possibilities with such a system as well. </p> </div>
