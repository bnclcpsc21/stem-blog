			<p align = "justify">You've undoubtedly seen memes featuring colorful Teletubby-like figures dressed in spacesuits if you've 
			spent some time on Twitter or with a person under the age of 30. These are the characters from Among Us, a game that has 
			exploded in popularity in recent months.</p> 	 	
			<br><b><font color = "orange"> Here are some facts that you need to know about Among Us. </p></b></font>
			<br>			
			<p align = "justify">Among Us is an online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American game studio 
			Innersloth. It is a murder mystery sci-fi experience that has swept the gaming community during the pandemic. It was released 
			on iOS and Android devices in June 2018 and on Windows in November 2018, featuring cross-platform play between these platforms.
			The game received positive reviews from critics, being praised for its gameplay and setting, although it was criticized for
			its technical issues. In response to the game's popularity, Among Us 2 was announced in August 2020. However, the planned 
			sequel was canceled a month later, and the team shifted its focus to improving the original game. Merchandise based on the 
			game, such as toys, shirts, etc., were announced and released. Among Us has also inspired internet memes and achieved a very 
			large following online. It is a multiplayer game for four to ten players. Up to three players are randomly chosen to be the 
			impostor each round. A round can take place on one of four maps: a spaceship called "The Skeld"; a headquarters building called 
			"MIRA HQ"; a planet base called "Polus"; At the start of the game, Crewmates are assigned "tasks" to complete around the map 
			in the form of minigames, consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as fixing wires and downloading data. Ghosts 
			help their living teammates by completing their tasks or performing sabotages . To help the Crewmates identify Impostors, 
			there are various surveillance systems on each map, such as security cameras system on The Skeld, and a vitals indicator in 
			Polus. Any living player may call a group meeting by reporting a dead body, or by pressing the Emergency Meeting button at any 
			time. During a meeting, players discuss who they believe is an Impostor based on the available evidence. A plurality vote is
			held, and the chosen player is ejected from the map and they become a ghost. There are also many cosmetic options, including
			spacesuit colors, skins, hats, and pets, The idea for the concept was originally gave by Marcus Bromander, co-founder of 
			Innersloth, who had played Mafia since he was a kid. The game was initially intended to be a mobile-only local multiplayer 
			game with a single map. Shortly after release, Among Us had an average player count of 30 to 50 concurrent players.</p></div>
