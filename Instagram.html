			<p align = "justify">Instagram (commonly abbreviated to IG or Insta) is an American photo and video sharing social 
			networking service created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. In April 2012, Facebook acquired the service for approximately 
			US$1 billion in cash and stock. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags 
			and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content 
			by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add their content to a personal 
			feed. Instagram was originally distinguished by only allowing content to be framed in a square (1:1) aspect ratio with 640
			pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, these restrictions were eased with an increase to 1080 
			pixels. The service also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a 
			Stories feature—similar to its main opposition Snapchat—which allows users to post photos and videos to a sequential feed, 
			with each post accessible by others for 24 hours each. As of January 2019, the Stories feature is used by 500 million users 
			daily.</p> 	 
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Instagram began development in San Francisco as Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and 
			Mike Krieger. Realizing that Burbn was too similar to Foursquare, Systrom and Krieger refocused their app on photo-sharing, 
			which had become a popular feature among Burbn users. They renamed the app Instagram, a portmanteau of "instant camera" and 
			"telegram".</p> 
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Instagram was initially made for iPhone users, but almost immediately spread to other mobile formats like 
			Android. Now, Instagram is easy to download and install, whichever your mobile platform is. Whether you’re an iOS or Android 
			user, you can go the App Store or Play Store, download, set up your account, choose a username and upload a profile pic. With 
			these five easy steps, you are already set. Taking photos can be easy to do within the app or through your phone’s camera. 
			You can use the photos from the app or from those that exist in your camera roll and you can then give your photo a title, 
			making it more engaging and fun. Its photo sharing capability is not only limited on Instagram, but also to other social media 
			apps like Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Tumbler and Posterous. Your photos are public by default, but you can also set them to 
			private if you want other people to request for your permission first before they follow you. </p> </div>
