			<p align = "justify">Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (stylized as zoom or simply Zoom) is an American communications technology
			company headquartered in San Jose, California. It provides videotelephony and online chat services through a cloud-based
			peer-to-peer software platform and is used for teleconferencing, telecommuting, distance education, and social relations. </p> 	 	
			<br>			
			<p align = "justify">Eric Yuan, a former Cisco engineer and executive, founded Zoom in 2011, and launched its software in 
			2013. Zoom's aggressive revenue growth, and perceived ease-of-use and reliability of its software, resulted in a $1 
			billion valuation in 2017, making it a "unicorn" company. The company first became profitable in 2019, and completed 
			an initial public offering that year. The company joined the NASDAQ-100 stock index on April 30, 2020.<p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Beginning in early 2020, Zoom's software usage saw a significant global increase following the introduction 
			of quarantine measures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its software products have faced public and media 
			scrutiny related to security and privacy issues due to unexpected usage. A portion of Zoom's workforce is based 
			in China, which has given rise to surveillance and censorship concerns.</p>
			<br><b><font color = "orange"> Impact of Zoom on education </p></b></font>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Video communications allow educational institutions
			to expand their impact across geographies to reach
			more students and offer new learning opportunities
			from guest lecturers, to research among
			institutions, to reaching students off campus.
			Regardless of whether it is known as eLearning or
			distance learning, the use of video communications
			increases productivity, reduces training costs, allows
			access to subject matter experts (regardless of
			location), and offers students real-time, immediate
			access to classes and course materials.
			The combination of multimedia and instructional
			design, coupled with practice activities and
			feedback, results in a learning environment that
			helps students retain course content. Learners
			want control of their time and eLearning gives them
			the opportunity to learn from anywhere at any time.
			To remain competitive and increase revenue,
			educational institutions need to use video
			communications to reach existing and new
			students, provide access to outside experts,
			collaborate with other institutions, and virtually
			communicate with students, faculty and staff.<p></div>
