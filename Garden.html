			<p align = "justify">Gardenscapes is the creation of Playrix, a game development company from Russia, founded by two brothers, 
			Dmitri and Igor Bukhman. They created Playrix in 2004 and for a while, they focused on casual games for PC. So, at first 
			Gardenscapes was designed for desktop. It took the team four years to build Gardenscapes for mobile. In August, 2016 the game 
			was launched on main app stores and it became popular also in China and Japan, as VentureBeat highlights. In the same year, 
			Facebook named Gardenscapes the game of the year. With over 800 experts located all over the world, the main goal is to offer 
			high â€“ quality products and this is obvious when you think about the success of Gardenscapes and other three games created 
			by Playrix, Homescapes, Fishdom, and Township. For Gardenscapes, the storyline and the gameplay attract users and offer them 
			a great experience. The game is available on Apple App Store and Google Play Store.</p> 	 	
			<br>			
			<p align = "justify">Gardenscapes: New Acres is a match-three puzzle game, where the core gameplay is based on swapping 
			two adjacent elements to make a row or column or group of at least three elements. Every level has a goal, examples of which 
			include collecting a certain number of elements (e.g., pears, flowers, apples, glasses of lemonade, mystery sacks, berries, 
			fishing floats), uncovering garden gnomes, digging up emeralds, setting off firecrackers,finding rabbits or removing ivy, all 
			accomplished through different match-three mechanics. By completing match-three levels, players earn stars and coins to complete
			tasks and progress through the storyline by unlocking new areas. As players complete tasks, they are allowed to choose between 
			three different decor items for a specific part of their garden, similarly to previous titles. Players also have the opportunity
			to make friends with in-game characters, follow them on an in-game social network, and have the company of an animated dog. As 
			of 1 April 2021, there are 8086 levels. Upon completing the final level, you may enter the golden cup where you can climb the 
			leaderboard to earn more prizes until the next set of levels comes out. Generally, 40 new levels are released every Thursday.</p></div>
