			<p align = "justify">In 2009, Minecraft was created by Markus Persson, also known as Notch and was originally called Cave Game.
			This game was different than other online games where you create things because instead of simply creating structures, 
			you also have to gather resources to build those structures. This mix was unusual because most games at the time usually 
			only had the player gather resources and not build or to build but not have to gather resources. On top of that, Minecraft
			was also a survival game. You have to survive hostile mobs and can explore the vast world. You can also use your resources 
			to craft new materials that you can use to create structures, survive longer, and craft more materials.</p> 	 	
			<br>			
			<p align = "justify">Once this small project started to take off, the creator released it in an updated format as Minecraft, 
			but that is still a far cry from the game we know today on PC and consoles. It was very basic, for the most part, but early
			versions of Minecraft allowed for more than just building. What made the game so unique is that it was also a resource management
			simulation. It allowed players to gather the resources they needed to create, so the creations meant more to them since they 
			had to build them with parts they had collected on their own. You can see the influence of this mechanic in games all over 
			today. Other games had players gathering resources before, but not usually to directly build something block by block with 
			their own digital hands. Now games like Skyrim, Terraria, and many others have incorporated a rather simple mechanic like 
			this in their games and as part of different genres and experiences.</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Minecraft is one of the video games that have been keeping Pinoys busy. In addition to building your own 
			world in the game, you can now go on an online tour of historical landmarks in the Philippines. So for anyone who has ever been 
			told that gaming canâ€™t be a learning experience, you can add this to your list of arguments to help your case.</p></div>
