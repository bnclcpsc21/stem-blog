			<p align = "justify">The Philippines consist of 7,000 islands, mountainous roads, waterways, remote villages and a population 
			of over 90 million spread across which make it difficult for formal financial networks to reach out and provide even basic services. 
			Around 80% of the Philippine population remains unbanked/under-banked often had to travel far to make a simple financial transactions.
			The use of mobile phones gained focus in the Philippines especially among the low- income groups and Globe realised that 
			mobile phones could be used as a low cost, high penetration access channel for delivering financial services.</p>	
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Thus, in 2004 Globe Telecom launched G Cash, the electronic money concept which allowed users to
			make purchases, pay and receive domestic payments and receive remittances by converting their actual money to electronic 
			money and electronic money into actual money at any of the Globe’s Cash In and Cash Out Center/Outlets, via the mobile phone.</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">The client can register in the system through SMS inputting some key information such as name, 
			address and phone number. The user will then receive a reference number and TAP identification number through Globe 
			Telecom’s SMS facility. Once registered, the client can go to any Globe Cash In Center/Outlet to convert actual money
			to electronic money. The process addresses security concerns, as the client will provide a valid ID card and fills in the 
			necessary forms in the Globe Cash In Center/Outlet.</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Once the verification and processing is completed, the electronic money amount is sent to the mobile 
			phone with a reference number. The client can then use the loaded electronic money to pay the rural bank by simply sending 
			a text message with the amount and the personal identification number (PIN) to satisfy security concerns. Again, both the 
			sender and receiver will get a confirmation of the transaction. There is bare minimum investment on equipment or infrastructure 
			to be able to use the service since the service can be used using most ordinary mobile phones also.</p> 	
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">“GCash continues to empower more Filipinos with digital financial tools and services, allowing for safe
			and convenient transactions amidst the various levels of quarantines,” Sazon said. She noted the increasing adoption of GCash 
			even for fishermen selling their catch and accepting payment via GCash. "But above all, we saw how Filipinos are in need of services 
			that can enable them to function and do their normal day-to-day activities even when they are staying at home. Other than having 
			the power to conveniently shop at home, people also want to conduct their other errands online -- and GCash is here to support 
			those needs," she added.</p> </div>
