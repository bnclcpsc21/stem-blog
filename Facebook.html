			<p align = "justify">Facebook (stylized as facebook) is an American online social media and social networking service based in 
			Menlo Park, California, and a flagship service of the namesake company Facebook, Inc. It was founded by Mark Zuckerberg, along 
			with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.Facebook 
			is a social networking service launched as TheFacebook on February 4, 2004. It was founded 
			by Mark Zuckerberg and college roommates and fellow Harvard University students, in particular Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum,
			Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. The website's membership was initially limited by the founders to Harvard students, 
			but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and gradually most universities in the United States 
			and Canada corporations, and by September 2006, to everyone with a valid email address along with an age requirement 
			of being 13 and older. </p> 	 
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Zuckerberg built a website called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending Harvard University. The site was 
			comparable to Hot or Not and used "photos compiled from the online face books of nine Houses, placing two next to each other 
			at a time and asking users to choose the "hotter" person". Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its 
			first four hours. The site was sent to several campus group listservs, but was shut down a few days later by Harvard 
			administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged with breaching security, violating copyrights and violating 
			individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped. Zuckerberg expanded on this project that semester by creating 
			a social study tool ahead of an art history final exam. He uploaded all art images to a website, each of which was accompanied 
			by a comments section, then shared the site with his classmates.</p> 
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">A "face book" is a student directory featuring photos and personal information. In 2003, Harvard had 
			only a paper version along with private online directories. Zuckerberg told The Harvard Crimson, "Everyone's been 
			talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard. ... I think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a 
			couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week." In January 2004, 
			Zuckerberg coded a new website, known as "TheFacebook", inspired by a Crimson editorial about Facemash, stating, "It is clear 
			that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available ... the benefits are many." Zuckerberg met with 
			Harvard student Eduardo Saverin, and each of them agreed to invest $1,000 in the site. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg 
			launched "TheFacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.</p> 
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">On February 4, 2004, a Harvard sophomore named Mark Zuckerberg launches The Facebook, originally located at 
			thefacebook.com. A social media website he had built in order to connect Harvard students with one another. By the next day, 
			over a thousand people had registered, and that was only the beginning. Now known simply as Facebook, the site quickly ballooned 
			into one of the most  significant social media companies in history. Today, Facebook is one of the most valuable companies in 
			the world, with over 2 billion monthly active users. The origins of Facebook have been highly scrutinized (including in the
			critically acclaimed 2010 film The Social Network), but the exact source of the idea remains unclear. What is obvious is that 
			Zuckerberg had twin gifts for coding and causing a stir, both of which served him well at Harvard. The previous year, he had 
			become a campus celebrity by creating FaceMash, a website where students could vote on which of two randomly-selected Harvard 
			women was more attractive, and quickly running afoul of both the administration and several women's groups. FaceMash was short-
			lived but popular, leading Zuckerberg to consider the value of creating a campus-wide social network.</p> </div>
