			<p align = "justify">Call of Duty: Mobile is a free-to-play shooter video game developed by TiMi Studios and published by 
			Activision for Android and iOS. Released on 1 October 2019, the game saw one of the largest mobile game launches in history, 
			generating over US$480 million with 270 million downloads within a year. Players can choose to play ranked or non-ranked matches 
			in multiplayer mode. It has two types of in-game currencies: "Credits", which are earned through playing the game, and "COD
			Points", which have to be bought with real world money. It is possible to play the full game without paying, though some
			exclusive character and weapon skins can only be bought with COD Points. Apart from standard matchmaking, a private room 
			for both the multiplayer and battle royale modes can also be accessed where players can invite and battle with just their 
			in-game friends. The multiplayer mode is the basic first person shooter, similar to previous Call of Duty games on other 
			platforms along with old maps. The core game modes include Team Deathmatch, Domination, Free for All, Hardpoint, Kill Confirmed, 
			etc. The game also have "Scorestreaks", which are special weapons that are available as the player reaches certain times and
			points. Additionally, the game features special and limited multiplayer modes that may last for days, weeks, or a whole game
			season. These include: Prop Hunt, Rapid Fire, Sticks and Stones, 2v2, Capture the Flag, One Shot One Kill, 
			Snipers Only, and Gun Game, among others.</p> 	 	
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Call of Duty: Mobile features many playable characters, maps, and game modes from previous games in the 
			series. Different control settings were included to cater to player's preferences. A "zombies" game mode was added to
			the game in November 2019. This game mode followed the classic Call of Duty zombies "survival" formula where the player fights 
			off endless waves of zombies, aiming to survive as long as possible. A "Raid" mode was also included where the player had to 
			defeat a set amount of waves of zombies before encountering one of two final bosses. Call of Duty: Mobile Zombies mode 
			was removed on March 25, 2020 due to the game mode not meeting Activision's standards. </p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">In its first month, the game had over 148 million downloads and generated nearly US$54 million in revenue,
			making it the largest mobile game launch in history. By June 2020, the game had seen over 250 million downloads, generating 
			over $327 million in revenue. By October 2020, that figure had risen to over $480 million with 270 million downloads.</p> </div>
