			<p align = "justify">Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) developed and published 
			by Moonton. Released in 2016, the game has become popular in Southeast Asia and was among the games chosen for the first medal 
			event esports competition at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines. In July 2018, Tencent (which also developed 
			similar games, Arena of Valor) on behalf of Riot Games won a lawsuit in Shanghai No.1 Intermediate People's Court against 
			Moonton's CEO Watson Xu Zhenhua (as he had previously worked in Tencent as one of Tencent's senior employee), for violating a 
			law regarding Non-Compete Agreements along with Mobile Legends' plagiarism of League of Legends, and was awarded a settlement 
			of $2.9 million. After Moonton finished developing its first game called Magic Rush: Heroes, released in 2015, they proceeded 
			with developing the company's next project, a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game later titled Mobile Legends. 
			Mobile Legends was released by Moonton with the subtitle "5v5 MOBA" on 14 July 2016. The game is distributed by Elex Tech in 
			the United States. According to a scan of published apps on Google Play by Check Point Research last June 2019, Mobile Legends: 
			Bang Bang was affected by CVE-2015-8271 (FFmpeg RTMP video streaming), a vulnerability that also affected popular apps like
			Facebook, Messenger, and SHAREit. In early 2020, the game was heavily affected by third-party plugins and scripts that allowed
			map-hacks prompting Moonton to publicly publish punishments made through its social media accounts revealing the account ID 
			of the banned players. Some accounts were also hacked due to exploits to Device ID that may have been due to the third-party 
			scripts according to an official statement from Moonton. In response, patch 1.4.86 enabled two-factor authentication when 
			logging in to a new device. </p> 	 
			<br><b><font color = "orange">What Makes Mobile Legends Popular? </p></b></font>	
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Mobile Legends has quickly become one of the leading mainstay titles of MOBA. Not only is it quite popular, 
			but it is also an in-demand game among different gaming circles. It boasts over 10 million accounts on both the Google Play 
			Store and Apple App Store. Want to know more about Mobile Legends popularity? Well, here are some facts about its fame. Easy 
			To Play For people who had no experience with similar games before, there is nothing to worry about – this game offers a simple 
			gameplay. It offers vast tutorials to get new players onboard quickly — from shooting and hitting to determining the key 
			direction of movement to using skills, just to name a few. In fact, it is dubbed as the mobile version of yet another popular 
			MOBA, DotA 2. Intuitive Game Control Thanks to its virtual pad feature, players can easily control all movement of a character
			or hero. There is no need to point a finger at the enemy, as it comes with an auto-aim feature. Moreover, the virtual pad 
			automatically adjusts a hero’s movement, making transitions a breeze. Good Graphics For some people, when it comes to playing 
			a game, the graphics aspect is a huge aspect. If it proves to be good, then players will be interested to play it. Mobile 
			Legends does this in a way that its contemporaries fail to do so. It offers good graphics in terms of characters, items, 
			skill effects, and even the in-game landscape. Sure, it is not perfect, but it is absolutely enough for a mobile game. 
			Playable With Friends This mobile game allows players to play alongside their friends, and it is applicable in all game modes.
			They just have to activate/connect their Facebook and/or e-mail ID, so players can connect to their friends and play together.
			Characters Representing Different Countries This is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Mobile Legends. All of its
			heroes are created based on the various countries they are from. For instance, Bruno represents Brazil while Yin Sun-Shin is 
			from Korea; Kagura is from Japan, Chou is from China, and so on. </p> </div>
