			<p align = "justify">Google Classroom is a free web service developed by Google for schools that aims to simplify creating, 
			distributing, and grading assignments. The primary purpose of Google Classroom is to streamline the process of sharing files 
			between teachers and students. It is estimated between 40 to 100 million people use Google Classroom.</p> 	 	
			<br>			
			<p align = "justify">Google Classroom integrates Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, and Calendar into a cohesive platform to 
			manage student and teacher communication. Students can be invited to join a class through a private code, or automatically 
			imported from a school domain. Teachers can create, distribute and mark assignments all within the Google ecosystem. Each 
			class creates a separate folder in the respective user's Drive, where the student can submit work to be graded by a teacher. 
			Assignments and due dates are added to Google calendar, each assignment can belong to a category (or topic). Teachers can 
			monitor the progress for each student by reviewing revision history of a document, and after being graded, teachers can 
			return work along with comments.<p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Google Classroom was announced on May 6, 2014, with a preview available for some members of Google's 
			G Suite for Education program. It was released publicly on August 12, 2014. In 2015 Google announced a Classroom 
			API and a share button for websites, allowing school administrators and developers to further engage with Google Classroom. 
			Also in 2015, Google integrated Google Calendar into Classroom for assignment due dates, field trips, and class speakers. 
			In 2017, Google opened Classroom to allow any personal Google users to join classes without the requirement of having a G Suite 
			for Education account, and in April of the same year, it became possible for any personal Google user to create and teach a 
			class.</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">In 2018, Google introduced a major redesign to Classroom. This included adding a new classwork section,
			improving the grading interface, allowing reuse of classwork from other classes, and adding features for teachers to organize 
			content by topic. In 2019, Google introduced 78 new illustrated themes and the option to drag and drop topics and assignments 
			in the classwork section. In 2020, Google added better integration with Google Meet so that teachers can have a unique meet 
			link within each class. In addition, several features were added to classroom, with Google stating "as educators worldwide 
			have reinvented their practice online, we’re also adapting our tools to meet the evolving needs of their new educational 
			landscape." These updates included:<p>
			<br>
			• A new to-do widget
			<br>
			• 10 additional languages
			<br>
			• Better integration with learning management systems to create and distribute assignments
			<br>
			• Added smart correct and auto-compose to google docs
			<br	>
			<br>
		<p align = "justify">In 2020, usage of Google Classroom sharply increased when many schools shifted to remote education during the 
		COVID-19 pandemic.<p></div>
