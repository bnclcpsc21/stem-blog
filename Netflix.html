			<p align = "justify">Netflix, Inc. is an American content platform and production company headquartered in Los Gatos, California.
			Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California. The company's primary business is 
			a subscription-based streaming service offering online streaming from a library of films and television series, including those 
			produced in-house. In January 2021, Netflix reached 203.7 million subscribers, including 73 million in the United States. It is 
			available worldwide except in mainland China (due to local restrictions), Syria, North Korea, and Crimea (due to US sanctions). 
			It was reported in 2020 that Netflix's operating income is $1.2 billion. The company has offices in France, Brazil, the 
			Netherlands, India, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. Netflix is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA), 
			producing and distributing content from countries worldwide. </p> 	 
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">History Establishment Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings founded Netflix on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley,
			California. Randolph worked as a marketing director for Hastings's company, Pure Atria. Randolph had co-founded MicroWarehouse, 
			and a computer mail-orders company; Borland International later employed him as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a 
			computer scientist, and mathematician sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in the biggest 
			acquisition in Silicon Valley history. The two came up with the idea for Netflix when commuting between their homes in Santa 
			Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger. However, Hastings 
			has given several different explanations for how the idea came about. Hastings invested $2.5 million in startup cash for Netflix.
			Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the 
			Internet using a similar model. Hastings and Randolph considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too 
			delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, first introduced in the United States on March 24, 1997, they tested the concept 
			of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings's house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, 
			they decided to take on the $16 billion home-video sales and rental industry. Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided 
			to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store to return a copy of Apollo 13. Still, he and Randolph designed 
			this apocryphal story to explain the company's business model and motivation. Netflix launched as the world's first online DVD-
			rental store, with only 30 employees and 925 titles available—almost the entire catalog of DVDs at the time—using the pay-per-
			rent model, with rates and due dates similar to those of its brick-and-mortar competitor, Blockbuster.</p> 
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Netflix was an exact method of passing the time for many people who were quarantined or couldn't leave 
			their houses. The platform recognizes that is the reason for this popularity growth, and that's why they now have more than 
			182 million registered users worldwide.</p> </div>
