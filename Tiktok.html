			<p align = "justify">TikTok, known in China as Douyin, is a video-sharing social networking 
			service owned by Chinese company ByteDance. The social media platform is used to make a variety of short-form videos, from 
			genres like dance, comedy, and education, that have a duration from 15 seconds to one minute (three minutes for some users).
			TikTok is an international version of Douyin, which was originally released in the Chinese market in September 2016. Later, 
			TikTok was launched in 2017 for iOS and Android in most markets outside of mainland China; however, it only became available 
			worldwide after merging with another Chinese social media service, Musical.ly, on 2 August 2018. </p> 	 
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">Douyin was launched by ByteDance in Beijing, China in September 2016, originally under the name A.me, 
			before rebranding to Douyin in December 2016. ByteDance planned on Douyin expanding overseas. The founder of 
			ByteDance, Zhang Yiming, stated that "China is home to only one-fifth of Internet users globally. If we donâ€™t expand on a 
			global scale, we are bound to lose to peers eyeing the four-fifths. So, going global is a must." Douyin was developed in 
			200 days and within a year had 100 million users, with more than one billion videos viewed every day. TikTok was 
			launched in the international market in September 2017. On 23 January 2018, the TikTok app ranked No. 1 among free app 
			downloads on app stores in Thailand and other countries. TikTok has been downloaded more than 130 million times in the United 
			States, and has reached 2 billion downloads worldwide, according to data from mobile research firm Sensor Tower that 
			excludes Android users in China. In the United States, many celebrities including Jimmy Fallon and Tony Hawk began using 
			the application in 2018; other celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Alba, Will Smith, and Justin Bieber joined 
			TikTok as well and many other celebrities have followed. On 3 September 2019, TikTok and the US National Football League 
			(NFL) announced a multi-year partnership. The agreement occurred just two days before the NFL's 100th season kick-off at 
			the Soldier Field, where TikTok hosted activities for fans in honor of the deal. The partnership entails the launch of an 
			official NFL TikTok account, which is to bring about new marketing opportunities such as sponsored videos and hashtag challenges.
			In July 2020, TikTok, excluding Douyin, reported close to 800 million monthly active users worldwide after less than four years 
			of existence.</p> 
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">On 9 November 2017, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, spent up to US$1 billion to purchase musical.ly, a 
			startup headquartered in Shanghai with an overseas office in Santa Monica, California, US. Musical.ly was a social media 
			video platform that allowed users to create short lip-sync and comedy videos, initially released in August 2014. It was well
			known, especially to the younger audience. Looking forward to leveraging the US digital platform's young user base, TikTok merged
			with musical.ly on 2 August 2018 to create a larger video community, with existing accounts and data consolidated into one app, 
			keeping the title TikTok. This ended musical.ly and made TikTok a worldwide app, excluding China, since China already has 
			Douyin.</p> </div>
