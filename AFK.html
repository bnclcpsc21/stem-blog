			<p align = "justify">AFK Arena is a casual action card game. Players can build up a personalized team and level up with the unique 
			AFK Awards auto farming system. Join players all over the world in this journey of fantasy and prevent an ancient 
			evil from destroying the realm of Esperia.</p> 	 	
			<br>			
			<p align = "justify">AFK Arena (AFK being an old-school internet acronym for "away from keyboard") was developed by 
			Shanghai-based Lilith Games. A game I reviewed here earlier, Rise of Kingdoms, was also created by Lilith Games, and I 
			critiqued it for being very cash grabby in a way that made being a free-to-play game — aka F2P player — a fairly sour 
			experience. While AFK Arena is also eager (perhaps even a tad desperate) to get players to open their wallets, I'm happy 
			to say that it's a pretty OK game even for people who don't spend a dime. Boasting many traditional role-playing elements, 
			AFK Arena does have an actual storyline — something about stopping a demon from destroying the world. The story is a bit 
			secondary to the mechanics of the game, which is a shame. There are more than 40 hero units from six factions, and every 
			unit has its own fairly fleshed-out backstory. There is also lots of detailed art, the style of which makes me think of 
			fairy-tale picture books, and it's exquisite.</p>
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">The game will store up to 12 hours of AFK rewards at a time, meaning that logging in just a couple 
			times a day is all that's really needed to continually advance. There are also a special labyrinth to explore every two 
			days, guild events, daily and weekly quests to complete, a ranked-combat tower where you battle against other players' 
			teams and limited-time events, all of which give rewards of gold, experience, items and more. What's it take to complete 
			all that? Maybe 20 to 30 minutes a day. It's all optional, but one of the main rewards of completing the daily tasks is the 
			chance to earn the game's premium currency, Diamonds. Diamonds are used to summon new heroes, and because of the way the
			game's leveling system works, eventually players will need multiple copies of lots of different hero units to keep advancing 
			and getting stronger.</p></div>
