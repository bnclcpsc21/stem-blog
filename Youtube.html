			<p align = "justify">YouTube is an online video platform owned by Google. It is the second most-visited website in the world.
			In total, users watch more than one billion hours of YouTube videos per day, and hundreds of hours of video content are 
			uploaded to YouTube servers every minute. YouTube provides several ways to watch videos, including the website, the mobile apps, 
			and permitting other websites to embed them. Available content includes music videos, video clips, short and documentary films, 
			audio recordings, movie trailers, live streams, and video blogs. Most content is generated by individuals, but media 
			corporations also publish videos. Besides watching and uploading, registered users can comment on videos, rate them, create 
			playlists, and subscribe to other users. Founded in 2005, YouTube was acquired the following year by Google for US$1.65 billion. 
			It has become one of the company's most lucrative subsidiaries, earning $19.8 billion in 2020. YouTube and selected creators 
			earn advertising revenue from Google's AdSense program. The vast majority of videos are free to view, but some require a music 
			or premium subscription. </p> 	 
			<br>
			<p align = "justify">YouTube was founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. The trio were all early employees of PayPal
			which they left enriched after the company was bought by eBay. Hurley had studied design at Indiana University of 
			Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign. There are 
			multiple stories told of the company's founding. According to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen 
			developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had 
			been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred,
			but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party "was probably very strengthened by marketing 
			ideas around creating a story that was very digestible". Karim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from Janet 
			Jackson's role in the 2004 Super Bowl incident when her breast was exposed during her performance, and later from the 2004 
			Indian Ocean tsunami. Karim could not easily find video clips of either event online, which led to the idea of a video sharing 
			site. Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service, and had been 
			influenced by the website Hot or Not. They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of 
			themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward. Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, 
			with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any type of video.</p> </div>
